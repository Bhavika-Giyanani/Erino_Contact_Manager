## Overview  

Erino Contact Manager is intended for organizing Contacts, providing ease of access. It is built with a modern tech stack, focusing on CRUD operations for managing contacts, sorting, pagination, and effective UI design.  

---

## Features  
- CRUD Operations for easy contact management
- User-friendly interface created using **Material-UI**.  
- Fully functional sorting and pagination for efficient data presentation.  
- Backend powered by **MongoDB**, ensuring future scalability.  

---

## Tech Stack  

### Frontend:  
- React.js  
- Material-UI  

### Backend:  
- Node.js  
- Express.js  

### Database:  
- MongoDB  

---

## Installation and Setup  

### Prerequisites:  

Ensure you have the following installed:  
- **Node.js**: [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)  
- **MongoDB**: [Download MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass) or run a MongoDB server locally.
  

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/Bhavika-Giyanani/Erino_Contact_Manager.git

2. Install Dependencies
   ```bash
   npm run install-all

3. Run the Application
   ```bash
   npm run dev

## Assumptions  

- All fields in the form are required to be filled.  

---

## Database Choice  

MongoDB was chosen as the database due to its:  
- Future scalability.  
- Schema-less collections, allowing each document to have its own number and type of fields. This is essential as metadata for each client varies.  

---

## Challenges and Learnings  

- **Material-UI**: Initially unfamiliar, but with quick learning and practice, I adapted and enjoyed working with it.  
- **Sorting and Pagination**: These features were tricky to implement, but with constant efforts, I successfully achieved the required functionality.
